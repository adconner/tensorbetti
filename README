The ideal computation is implemented. One can tweak the main function to do
whatever computation is desired. Right now it generates a few random tensors
of low rank and writes their ideal components to the folder examples/.
This can be tweaked and run from the command line

$ sage tensorbetti.sage

or interactively

$ sage
sage: load('tensorbetti.sage')

Code works for at least Sage 9.5, but any version should do.
